# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains solutions for Advent of Code puzzles, organized by year, day, and part.


## Structure

- Each year is a top-level folder (e.g., `2025/`, `2026/`, ...)
- Each day is a subfolder under the year (e.g., `2025/1/`, `2025/2/`, ...)
- Each day folder contains:
  - `input.txt`: The puzzle input for that day
  - `*-part1.py`, `*-part2.py`: Python scripts for part 1 and part 2 solutions


## How to Run

1. Navigate to the desired year's and day's folder (e.g., `cd 2025/5`)
2. Run the solution script:
  ```bash
  python3 cafeteria-part1.py
  python3 cafeteria-part2.py
  ```


## Notes
- Each script reads from `input.txt` in its folder.
- Solutions are written in Python 3.
- Some scripts are optimized for memory efficiency when handling large input ranges.
